# Asset Tagging Application
Problem Statement
Currently, GCIT does not have a system to keep track of assets. There is a risk of assets such as furniture and electronic equipment being misplaced or lost. Moreover, the individual asset does not have a unique code to be identified; it is hectic work for the asset management team.
